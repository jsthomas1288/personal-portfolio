        <h2>Hey! I'm Jacob Thomas</h2>
        <p>
          I am a Mechanical Engineer turned Project Engineer turned Front End
          Developer. My current goals are to land a Front End Developer job,
          continue to learn and grow by becoming a Full Stack Developer and
          eventually become a Software Engineer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I like software development for three reasons - it fits my
          personality/characteristics, the work environment, and the type of
          people becoming software developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Software development fits my personality/characteristics for the same
          reason that I wanted to be a Mechanical Engineer; I have a very active
          imagination and I enjoy creating and innovating things that help
          people. I’ve always been fascinated with technology and growing up I
          believed engineering was the best way I could be involved with
          technology that helped people. Upon learning about software
          development I realized this is where the future is headed, my
          mechanical engineering skills would translate over, and I could use my
          active imagination to create and innovate technology that helps
          people.
        </p>

        <p>
          Based on the information I have received, I’ve concluded that most
          technology companies have a forward-thinking mindset and they are
          creating healthy work environments that increase productivity and give
          flexibility so that their employees can stay fresh and be able to do
          more things in life that they enjoy.
        </p>

        <p>
          In conducting my research and listening to software developers’
          stories I see all of these ordinary people that are teachers, youth
          ministers, gas station workers, retail workers, etc. transitioning
          into tech and transforming their lives for the better which is so
          inspirational and encouraging. These people are taking the leap of
          faith into the unknown and finding success in doing so. These are the
          type of people I want to surround myself with because I want to be a
          part of a team that has each other’s backs and pushes each other to be
          the best that they can be.
